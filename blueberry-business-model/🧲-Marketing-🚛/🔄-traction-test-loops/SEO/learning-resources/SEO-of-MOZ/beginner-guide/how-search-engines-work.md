# HOW SEARCH ENGINES WORK: CRAWLING, INDEXING, AND RANKING

## How do search engines work?

Search engines have three primary functions:

1. Crawl: Scour the Internet for content, looking over the code/content for each URL they find.
2. Index: Store and organize the content found during the crawling process. Once a page is in the index, itâ€™s in the running to be displayed as a result to relevant queries.
3. Rank: Provide the pieces of content that will best answer a searcher's query, which means that results are ordered by most relevant to least relevant.
