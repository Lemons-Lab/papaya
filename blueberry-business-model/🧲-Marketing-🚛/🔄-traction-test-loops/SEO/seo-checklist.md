# SEO Checklist.

## Crawling

**How does Google find a page?**

- Following links from other sites or pages
- Reading sitemaps

**Improve your crawling**

- ✅ (build sitemap for site)
- ✅ [Submit a sitemap](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/156184).
- Submit crawl requests for individual pages
- Use a simple, human-readable, and logical `URL paths` for your pages and provide clear and direct internal links within the site.
- If you use URL parameters on your site for navigation, for instance if you indicate the user's country in a global shopping site, use the URL parameters tool to tell Google about important parameters.
- ✅ **Use robots.txt wisely**: Use `robots.txt` to indicate to Google which pages you'd prefer Google to know about or crawl first, in order to protect your server load, not as a method to block material from appearing in the Google index.
- ✅ Use `hreflang` to point to alternate language pages.
- Clearly identify your canonical page and alternate pages.
- View your crawl and index coverage using the Index Coverage Report
